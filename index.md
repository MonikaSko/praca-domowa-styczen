## Environments I like to work in
  
  1. Home-office (any place in the world) or hybrid.
  2. Pets and knowledge friendly.  
  3. Well-organized organization.  
  4. Inspiring and open-minded.  


## Preferred working hours  
	
A well-structured fixed schedule would be an awesome thing, but I am flexible and can adapt to changing environments. I like to keep my work-life balance and have a healthy relationship with my computer.  

## Communication preferences  

* For everyday communication: phone, e-mail, Teams, Skype.  
* For integration purposes: Teams, Skype, and in-person meetings.  

## Preferred ways to receive feedback  

If in-person feedback is not possible, I would like to organize a video call. Body language is essential and can convey information lost during writing. I want to know what I can improve and what I’m doing well.  

## Things I need  
* **Coffee.** First things first, coffee helps me gather my thoughts and keep peace of mind.  
* Friendly and inspiring atmosphere.  
* Time to focus.  
* Time to share my thoughts with colleagues and brainstorm.  

## How I learn best  
I like Googling things and gathering information on my own first, but then I like to check with experts if all I’ve found is correct.  

## Things I struggle with  
Impostor syndrome and rude people.  

## Things I love  
* Languages.  
* Reading.  
* Writing.  
* Dark humor.  

## If I were an animated gif/meme/animal/song, I would be...  
* **Animal** - panda
* **Song** - Spiece Girls “Wannabe”
